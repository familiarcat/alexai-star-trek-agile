## 🎯 **ACTIVATION REQUIRED**

### **Manual Activation Steps** ⚙️
The workflow has been successfully deployed but requires manual activation through the n8n GUI:

1. **🌐 Visit n8n Instance**: https://n8n.pbradygeorgen.com/workflows
2. **📋 Find Workflow**: Look for "AlexAI Crew Coordination Workflow"
3. **🔄 Activate Workflow**: Click the toggle switch to activate
4. **✅ Verify Status**: Confirm the workflow shows as "Active"

### **Expected n8n GUI View** 👁️
```
Workflows Tab:
├── Screenplay (Inactive)
├── My workflow 2 (Inactive)  
├── Build Your First AI Agent (Inactive)
└── AlexAI Crew Coordination Workflow (Ready to Activate) ⭐
```

## 🧪 **TESTING THE DEPLOYMENT**

### **Post-Activation Testing** 🔬
Once manually activated in the n8n GUI, test the webhook:

```bash
# Test the deployed workflow
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Hello from CursorAI", "context": "deployment-test", "userRole": "developer"}' \
  https://n8n.pbradygeorgen.com/webhook/crew-request
```

### **Expected Response Flow** 🌊
1. **Request Analyzer** receives the webhook call
2. **Crew Selector** uses OpenRouter to determine best crew member
3. **Crew Router** routes to appropriate endpoint (Picard/Data/Observation Lounge)
4. **Response Handler** returns the crew member's response
