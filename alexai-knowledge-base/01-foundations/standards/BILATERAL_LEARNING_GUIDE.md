# ðŸ”„ Bilateral Learning System Guide

## Purpose
The bilateral learning system ensures that every new piece of knowledge (markdown files and shell scripts) automatically enhances our AI agents' capabilities.

## How It Works
1. **File Detection**: System monitors for new .md and .sh files
2. **Content Analysis**: Extracts key insights and categorizes knowledge
3. **Agent Enhancement**: Relevant agents receive knowledge updates
4. **Capability Expansion**: Agents incorporate new learnings into responses

## Agent Enhancement Mapping
- **Captain Picard**: Strategic insights, project management, leadership patterns
- **Lieutenant Data**: Technical procedures, system operations, analytical frameworks
- **Counselor Troi**: Team dynamics, user experience, collaboration insights
- **Chief Engineer Scott**: Engineering solutions, optimization techniques, troubleshooting
- **Commander Spock**: Logical frameworks, system evolution, analytical methods
- **Lieutenant Worf**: Security protocols, risk management, protection strategies

## Benefits
- **Continuous Growth**: Knowledge base grows with each solution
- **Automatic Enhancement**: No manual intervention required
- **Contextual Learning**: Agents learn from real project experiences
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Shared knowledge across all crew members

## Monitoring
Use `/api/knowledge` to track knowledge base growth and agent enhancements.
