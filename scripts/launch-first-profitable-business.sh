# 🎤 **SALES SCRIPT - AI CONSULTING**

## 🚀 **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from AlexAI Strategic Consulting. I help companies automate their manual processes with AI and typically save them 40-60% on operational costs. I'm calling because I noticed [Company Name] is growing rapidly, and I wanted to see if you're experiencing any challenges with manual processes or scaling operations?"

## 💡 **Discovery Questions (2-3 minutes)**
1. "What are your biggest operational challenges right now?"
2. "How much time do your employees spend on repetitive tasks?"
3. "What would it mean to your business if you could automate 80% of manual processes?"
4. "What's your timeline for implementing new solutions?"
5. "Who else would be involved in making this decision?"

## 🎯 **Value Proposition (1 minute)**
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like AI automation could help you [specific benefit]. We've helped companies like yours save [specific amount] and improve [specific metric] within [timeframe]. Our typical client sees ROI within 30-90 days."

## 💰 **Investment Discussion (1 minute)**
"Our solutions range from $15,000 for a basic assessment to $75,000 for full implementation. Given your situation, I'd recommend starting with a $35,000 pilot project that would deliver [specific results] within [timeframe]."

## 🚀 **Next Steps (30 seconds)**
"I'd love to schedule a 30-minute assessment to show you exactly how much AI automation could save your company. I have availability [specific times] this week. What works best for you?"

## 📞 **Objection Handling**

### **"We're not ready for AI yet"**
"Many companies feel that way initially. That's exactly why we start with a readiness assessment. We've found that most companies are more ready than they think, and the companies that wait often get left behind by competitors."

### **"It's too expensive"**
"I understand the concern about cost. Let me ask you this: if I could show you how to save $100,000 annually with a $35,000 investment, would that be worth exploring? Most of our clients see ROI within 90 days."

### **"We need to think about it"**
"Of course, this is an important decision. What specific concerns do you have that I can address? Also, what would need to happen for you to move forward with this?"

### **"Send me some information"**
"I'd be happy to send you some case studies and information. But to make it most relevant to your situation, let me ask: what specific challenges are you facing that I should focus on in the materials I send?"
