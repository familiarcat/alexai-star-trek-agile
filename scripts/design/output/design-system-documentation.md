# LCARS Design System Documentation

## Overview
The LCARS Design System is inspired by Star Trek's computer interface, featuring:
- Clean, functional design
- Accent-focused icons
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Responsive design patterns

## Design Principles
1. **Functionality First** - UI elements serve user needs
2. **Visual Hierarchy** - Clear information organization
3. **Consistency** - Unified design language
4. **Accessibility** - Inclusive design for all users
5. **Responsiveness** - Optimized for all devices

## Icon Philosophy
Icons are visual accents that support functionality, not dominate it:
- Small, subtle sizes (8px-16px)
- Low opacity for minimal visual noise
- Contextual sizing based on component type
- Consistent styling across all interfaces

## Color Palette
- Primary: Bold, attention-grabbing colors
- Secondary: Supporting, complementary colors
- Accent: Highlighting and emphasis colors
- Neutral: Text, backgrounds, and borders

## Typography
- Font: Antonio (Star Trek-inspired)
- Hierarchy: Clear size progression
- Readability: Optimized for all screen sizes
- Accessibility: High contrast and clear spacing
