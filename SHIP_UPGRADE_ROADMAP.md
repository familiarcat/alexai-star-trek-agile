#### **Version Control Strategy**
```bash
# Create refit branch
git checkout -b ship-refit-ncc-1701-a-3-0

# Implement improvements
git add .
git commit -m "üññ Ship Refit: NCC-1701-A.3.0 - System stabilization and performance optimization"

# Tag the refit
git tag -a v2.3.0 -m "NCC-1701-A.3.0 - Ship Refit Complete"
```

### **Phase 2: New Ship Construction (NCC-1701-B)**

     suggestOptimizations(project: Project): OptimizationSuggestion[];
     monitorTeamHealth(team: Team): HealthReport;
   }
   ```

2. **Advanced Real-time Collaboration**
   ```typescript
   // CRDT-based conflict resolution
   interface CRDTManager {
     resolveConflicts(operations: Operation[]): Resolution;
     mergeChanges(local: Change[], remote: Change[]): MergedChange;
     maintainConsistency(state: State): ConsistentState;
   }
   ```

3. **Offline-First Architecture**
   ```typescript
   // Service worker for offline capabilities
   interface OfflineManager {
     syncWhenOnline(): Promise<void>;
     cacheResources(): Promise<void>;
     handleOfflineActions(): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

#### **Version Control Strategy**
```bash
# Create new ship branch
git checkout -b new-ship-ncc-1701-b

# Major version bump
npm version major  # v3.0.0

# Tag the new ship
git tag -a v3.0.0 -m "NCC-1701-B - New Ship Launch"
```

### **Phase 3: Ship Testing and Commissioning**
