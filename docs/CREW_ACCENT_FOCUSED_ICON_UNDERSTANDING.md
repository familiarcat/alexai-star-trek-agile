## 🎨 **New Icon Sizing Philosophy**

### **Before (Problem)**
- ❌ Icons too large (20px-32px base) competing with content
- ❌ Icons dominated visual attention
- ❌ Functionality obscured by decorative elements
- ❌ User intent unclear due to visual noise

### **After (Solution)**
- ✅ Icons properly sized (8px-16px base) as supporting accents
- ✅ Icons support functionality without dominating
- ✅ CTAs and user intent are primary focus
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy guides user attention

### **Icon Size Hierarchy (Accent-Focused)**
| Purpose | Size | Opacity | Role |
|---------|------|---------|------|
| **Metadata** | 8px | 0.4 | Barely visible accents |
| **Trend Data** | 10px | 0.5 | Minimal visual cues |
| **Navigation** | 12px | 0.6 | Subtle guides |
| **Actions** | 14px | 0.7 | Supporting elements |
| **Projects** | 16px | 0.7 | Subtle identifiers |
