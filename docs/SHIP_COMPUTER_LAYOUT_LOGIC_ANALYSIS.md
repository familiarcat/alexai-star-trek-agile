## üîÑ **Decision-Making Process**

### **Phase 1: User Intent Analysis**

The Ship Computer starts by analyzing user behavior and context to understand what the user is trying to accomplish:

```typescript
// User Intent Synthesis
const userIntent = {
  primary: 'complete-tasks' | 'manage-projects' | 'analyze-data' | 'explore-platform',
  secondary: ['find-information', 'engage-with-content', 'input-data'],
  urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical',
  complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex',
  emotionalState: 'focused' | 'exploratory' | 'frustrated' | 'excited',
  userRole: 'developer' | 'manager' | 'analyst' | 'executive' | 'general'
}
```

**Decision Logic:**

  position: 'top',
  size: 'full',
  visibility: 'always',
  userIntentAlignment: 0.95,
  responsiveConstraints: {
    minWidth: 320, maxWidth: 1920,
    minHeight: 60, maxHeight: 80,
    overflow: 'visible', flexShrink: 0, flexGrow: 0
  }
}

// Content Components (Medium Priority)
{
  id: 'main-content',
  type: 'content',
  priority: 2,
  position: 'center',
  size: 'large',
  visibility: 'always',
  userIntentAlignment: 0.90,
  responsiveConstraints: {
    minWidth: 300, maxWidth: 1600,
    minHeight: 400, maxHeight: 800,
    overflow: 'auto', flexShrink: 1, flexGrow: 1
  }
}

// Action Components (Context-Dependent)
{
  id: 'primary-actions',
  type: 'action',
  priority: 3,
  position: 'right',
  size: 'medium',
  visibility: 'conditional',
  userIntentAlignment: 0.85,
  responsiveConstraints: {
    minWidth: 200, maxWidth: 400,
    minHeight: 100, maxHeight: 300,
    overflow: 'auto', flexShrink: 0, flexGrow: 0
