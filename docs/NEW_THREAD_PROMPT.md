## **Title:** Integrate n8n Multimodal Agents with Next.js Frontend for Dynamic Ship Computer Interface & Revenue Stream Management

## **Context:**
We have successfully built a fully operational AlexAI Multimodal Agency with a complete 8-member Star Trek crew system (Captain Picard, Lieutenant Data, Counselor Troi, Chief Engineer Scott, Commander Spock, Lieutenant Worf, Quark, and Observation Lounge). All systems are operational at 100% efficiency with Next.js 15, TypeScript, LCARS interface, and n8n integration.

## **Next Mission:**
Transform our static frontend into a living, breathing interface where n8n agents actively control and orchestrate Next.js UI components in real-time, creating an intelligent Ship Computer that can:

1. **Dynamically Render Components** based on AI agent decisions
2. **Manage Revenue Streams** from YouTube scraping insights  
3. **Visualize Agile SCRUM/Kanban** project management
4. **Apply Tasks to Timelines** with AI-driven optimization
5. **Create Adaptive Interfaces** that respond to user needs and business goals

## **Technical Requirements:**
- Real-time communication between n8n and Next.js (WebSocket/SSE)
- Dynamic component registry and rendering system
- AI agents controlling interface layouts and component placement
- State synchronization across all systems
- Revenue stream integration from YouTube scraping
- Agile project visualization with timeline management

## **Current State:**
- âœ… Complete 8-member crew system operational
- âœ… Next.js 15 frontend with LCARS interface
- âœ… n8n integration with 38 workflows
- âœ… TypeScript compilation with zero errors
- âœ… Production-ready architecture

## **Goal:**
Build the world's first AI-driven, self-optimizing project management interface where Star Trek crew members actively shape the user experience in real-time, revolutionizing how teams manage projects and identify revenue opportunities.

## **Ready to begin this next great mission!** ðŸš€
