# üéâ Icon Transformation Complete: From Oversized to Accent-Focused

## üéØ **Mission Accomplished: Icons Now Serve Their Proper Role**

### **‚úÖ Problem Identified and Solved**
**User Feedback**: "The icons are still way too large - they should be accents to each component they are describing and not the main visual focus - functionality to each component should be key, the icons are merely for visual accent"

**Solution Implemented**: Complete overhaul of icon sizing system to make icons truly accent-sized and supportive of functionality.
