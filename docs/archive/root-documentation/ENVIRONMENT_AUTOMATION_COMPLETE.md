./scripts/sync/sync-workflows.sh     # Auto-detects and sets up
```

### **Credential Management** 🔐
```bash
# Add credentials once in ~/.zshrc
export N8N_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-key"
# ... other credentials

# Reload shell
source ~/.zshrc

# Auto-generate .env for project
./scripts/setup/setup-environment.sh
```
