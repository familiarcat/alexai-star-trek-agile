# 🚀 AlexAI Unified Workflow Management System

## Overview

The AlexAI Unified Workflow Management System provides **automated and unified synchronization** between your local n8n workflows and those deployed to `n8n.pbradygeorgen.com`. This system ensures **constantly updated unification** between all workflows used in the application, with the ultimate goal of consolidating them into a master workflow.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **🔄 Real-time Bilateral Sync**: Continuous synchronization between local and remote workflows
- **🧹 Duplicate Detection**: Identifies and helps clean up duplicate workflows
- **📤 Automated Deployment**: Deploys all local workflows to n8n automatically
- **🔧 Smart Conflict Resolution**: Handles conflicts between local and remote versions
- **🎯 Master Workflow Consolidation**: Creates a unified master workflow combining all capabilities
- **📊 Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time status and logging of all sync operations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Ensure your environment variables are loaded:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify the variables are set:
```bash
echo $N8N_BASE_URL
echo $N8N_API_KEY
```

### 2. Start the Unified Workflow Manager

```bash
npm run unify:workflows
```

This opens an interactive menu with all available actions.

### 3. Full Unification Process

For a complete setup, choose option 8 (Full unification) from the menu, or run:

```bash
npm run unify:workflows
# Choose option 8: Full unification (all steps)
```

## 📋 Available Commands

### Main Management Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run unify:workflows` | Interactive workflow management system |
| `npm run consolidate:master` | Create consolidated master workflow |
| `npm run sync:start` | Start bilateral sync manager |
| `npm run webhook:activate` | Activate critical webhooks |

### Individual Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **View Current n8n Workflows** | Shows all workflows currently deployed |
| **View Local Workflow Files** | Lists all local workflow files |
| **Clean Up Duplicates** | Identifies and guides cleanup of duplicates |
| **Deploy All Local Workflows** | Pushes all local workflows to n8n |
| **Activate Critical Workflows** | Ensures essential workflows are active |
| **Start Enhanced Sync** | Launches the bilateral sync manager |
| **Show Sync Status** | Displays current sync status and logs |

## 🔄 How the Bilateral Sync Works

### Real-time File Watching
- Monitors your `workflows/` directory for changes
- Automatically detects new, modified, or deleted workflow files
- Queues sync operations for processing

### Conflict Resolution
- **Smart Detection**: Identifies content conflicts between local and remote versions
- **Timestamp-based**: Uses modification times to determine the most recent version
- **Auto-merge**: Automatically resolves simple conflicts
- **Manual Review**: Flags complex conflicts for manual resolution

### Continuous Synchronization
- **Bidirectional**: Changes flow both ways (local ↔ remote)
- **Interval-based**: Regular sync every 60 seconds (configurable)
- **Real-time**: Immediate sync on file changes
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with retry mechanisms

## 🎯 Master Workflow Consolidation

### What It Does
The system automatically consolidates all your workflows into a single, comprehensive master workflow that:

- Combines the best features from all individual workflows
- Eliminates duplication and redundancy
- Provides a unified interface for all AlexAI capabilities
- Maintains backward compatibility

### When It Happens
- **Automatic**: Every 24 hours during normal operation
- **Manual**: Run `npm run consolidate:master` anytime
- **On-demand**: Triggered from the unified workflow manager

### How It Works
1. **Analysis**: Evaluates all workflows based on complexity, features, and recency
2. **Selection**: Chooses the most comprehensive workflow as the base
3. **Enhancement**: Adds capabilities from other workflows
4. **Deployment**: Saves locally and pushes to n8n
5. **Metadata**: Tracks consolidation history and source workflows

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Sync Settings (`bilateral-sync/config.json`)

```json
{
  "sync": {
    "enabled": true,
    "interval": 60,                    // Sync interval in seconds
    "bidirectional": true,             // Two-way synchronization
    "autoMerge": true,                 // Automatic conflict resolution
    "conflictResolution": "smart",     // Conflict resolution strategy
    "realTimeSync": true,              // Real-time file watching
    "changeDetection": "fileWatcher"   // Change detection method
  },
  "workflows": {
    "include": [                       // Workflows to include in sync
      "AlexAI*",
      "Crew*",
      "Coordination*"
    ],

## 🔍 Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Check Sync Status
```bash
npm run unify:workflows
# Choose option 7: Show sync status
```

### View Sync Logs
```bash
tail -f bilateral-sync/logs/sync.log
```

### Manual Sync Trigger
```bash
cd bilateral-sync/scripts
node enhanced-sync-manager.js sync
```

### Check for Duplicates
```bash
npm run unify:workflows
# Choose option 3: Clean up duplicate workflows
```

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Duplicate Workflows
**Symptoms**: Multiple identical workflows on n8n
**Solution**: Use the cleanup function in the unified workflow manager

### Issue: Sync Not Working
**Symptoms**: Changes not propagating between local and remote
**Solution**: 
1. Check if sync manager is running: `pgrep -f enhanced-sync-manager`
2. Restart sync: `npm run sync:start`
3. Check logs: `tail bilateral-sync/logs/sync.log`

### Issue: Workflow Deployment Fails
**Symptoms**: HTTP errors when deploying workflows
**Solution**:
1. Validate JSON files: `jq . workflows/*.json`
2. Check n8n API connectivity
3. Verify API key permissions

### Issue: Master Workflow Not Generated
**Symptoms**: No consolidated workflow created
**Solution**:
1. Ensure all workflows are valid JSON
2. Run manual consolidation: `npm run consolidate:master`
3. Check for errors in the consolidation process
