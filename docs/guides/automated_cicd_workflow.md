## 🚀 Quick Start

### **1. Initial Setup**

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x deployment/scripts/automated/*.sh
chmod +x .git/hooks/*

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install -g vercel
```

### **2. Create Your First Feature**

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
./deployment/scripts/automated/feature_branch_workflow.sh create-feature user-authentication

# Start developing...
# Make changes to your code

# Test your feature
./deployment/scripts/automated/feature_branch_workflow.sh test-feature user-authentication

# Deploy to staging
./deployment/scripts/automated/feature_branch_workflow.sh deploy-feature user-authentication

# Merge to main when ready
./deployment/scripts/automated/feature_branch_workflow.sh merge-feature user-authentication
```

### **3. Manual CI/CD Pipeline**

```bash
# Run the complete CI/CD pipeline manually
./deployment/scripts/automated/ci_cd_pipeline.sh
```

---

## 📋 Feature Branch Workflow

./deployment/scripts/automated/feature_branch_workflow.sh create-feature real-time-chat
./deployment/scripts/automated/feature_branch_workflow.sh create-feature mobile-responsive
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Switches to main branch
2. ✅ Pulls latest changes
3. ✅ Creates feature branch: `feature/<feature-name>`
4. ✅ Creates development checklist
5. ✅ Switches to new feature branch

### **Testing Features**

```bash
# Test a feature branch
./deployment/scripts/automated/feature_branch_workflow.sh test-feature <feature-name>
```

**What happens:**

2. ✅ Runs comprehensive test suite
3. ✅ Validates code quality
4. ✅ Checks import structure
5. ✅ Generates test report

### **Deploying Features**

```bash
# Deploy feature to staging
./deployment/scripts/automated/feature_branch_workflow.sh deploy-feature <feature-name>
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Switches to feature branch
2. ✅ Runs CI/CD pipeline
3. ✅ Deploys to staging environment
4. ✅ Validates deployment
5. ✅ Generates deployment report

### **Merging Features**

```bash
# Merge feature to main
./deployment/scripts/automated/feature_branch_workflow.sh merge-feature <feature-name>
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Runs tests on feature branch
2. ✅ Switches to main branch
3. ✅ Merges feature branch
4. ✅ Pushes to remote
5. ✅ Deletes feature branch
6. ✅ Triggers production deployment

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **1. Pre-commit Hook Fails**

**Problem:** Import errors or missing files

```bash
# Check import structure manually
python -c "from src.core.app import app; print('OK')"

# Verify required files exist
ls -la main.py src/core/app.py
```

#### **2. CI/CD Pipeline Fails**

**Problem:** Deployment or test failures
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f logs/ci_cd_*.log

# Run pipeline manually for debugging
./deployment/scripts/automated/ci_cd_pipeline.sh
```

#### **3. Feature Branch Issues**

**Problem:** Branch conflicts or merge issues
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check branch status
git status
git branch -a

# Resolve conflicts manually
git merge --abort  # if needed
git reset --hard HEAD  # if needed
```

### **Debug Mode**

Enable debug mode for detailed output:

```bash
# Set debug environment variable
export DEBUG=true

# Run pipeline with debug output
./deployment/scripts/automated/ci_cd_pipeline.sh
```
