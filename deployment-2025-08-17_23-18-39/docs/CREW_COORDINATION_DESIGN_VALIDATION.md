## 🎨 **Design Updates Implemented**

### **1. Icon Sizing System Overhaul**
- **Before**: Icons too large (32px base) obscuring component purpose
- **After**: Semantic sizing (20px base) with contextual hierarchy
- **Impact**: 37.5% size reduction with clear visual hierarchy

### **2. Semantic Icon Classes**
| Class | Size | Purpose | User Intent |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `.lcars-icon` | 20px | Standard actions | Primary interactions |
| `.lcars-icon-small` | 16px | Secondary actions | Supporting information |
| `.lcars-icon-large` | 24px | Primary actions | Important features |
| `.lcars-icon-xlarge` | 32px | Hero icons | Key system elements |

### **3. Contextual Icon Sizing**
- **`.lcars-kpi-icon`** (18px) - Key Performance Indicators
- **`.lcars-trend-icon`** (16px) - Trend data and analytics
- **`.lcars-meta-icon`** (14px) - Metadata and secondary info
- **`.lcars-action-icon`** (18px) - User actions and buttons
- **`.lcars-project-icon`** (24px) - Project identifiers
- **`.lcars-system-icon`** (20px) - System status and technical info

### **4. Responsive Scaling**
- **Desktop**: 100% icon sizes for detailed viewing
- **Tablet**: 90% icon sizes for balanced interaction
- **Mobile**: 80% icon sizes for touch optimization
