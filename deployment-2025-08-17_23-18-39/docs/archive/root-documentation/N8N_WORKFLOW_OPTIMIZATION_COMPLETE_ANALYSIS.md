Classification: ${queryType}
Urgency: ${urgency}
Previous selections: ${history}
`;
```

#### **3. Implement Learning Feedback** (20 minutes)
```javascript
// Add response quality tracking
const qualityMetrics = {
  responseTime: processingDuration,
  confidence: selectionConfidence,
  userSatisfaction: predicted,
  evolutionTriggers: identified
};
```

## 🎭 **CREW RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **🖖 Captain Picard - Strategic Decision**
> *"Both approaches have merit. The enhanced current workflow provides immediate improvements with minimal risk, while the optimized architecture positions us for unlimited future expansion. I recommend starting with strategic enhancement to prove the concept, then transitioning to the complete optimization as our foundation for all future applications."*

### **🤖 Lieutenant Commander Data - Technical Assessment**
> *"Analysis indicates the current workflow structure is operationally sound but architecturally limited. The 8-node optimized design provides superior processing capabilities, comprehensive error handling, and evolution mechanisms that will serve as the optimal foundation for future application development."*

### **⚙️ Chief Engineer Scott - Implementation Perspective**
> *"The current workflow is working, but it's like having a basic warp drive when you could have a quantum slipstream! The optimized architecture gives us the power to handle anything the future throws at us. I say we enhance the current one to keep things running smooth, then deploy the optimized version as our next-generation platform."*
